You just need a browser with an internet connection to run this application.
If you want to make any changes in the code, please make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. You can use any of the IDEs you prefer for development.
However I like to use VS Code IDE. I'll deploy the changes manually to the web application when I merge a PR, until we have some automation setup for it. The full web application is built on React. You can learn more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/).

Below are the tools or softwares I use personally :-
